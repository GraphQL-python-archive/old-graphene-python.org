Since I started working on *Graphene*, *Graphene-Django* and *Graphene-SQLAlchemy* the **support** from the community **has been amazing**.

As time passes, it's been increasingly hard for me to focus enough time on each of these projects.

For the last few weeks I've been quite occupied trying to **optimize the GraphQL engine** in Python (news to come soon!), **GraphQL subscriptions** and the latest version of Graphene: **2.0**.
Unfortunately I haven't been able to keep the same pace in all the graphene sub-projects: *Graphene-Django*, *Graphene-SQLAlchemy* and *Graphene-GAE*.

Because of that I decided that it is time to start to delegating people that can spend the time required to make each of these projects shine.

**While I will still be active on all these projects**, all contributors are going to ensure that each of the projects evolve in the *right direction* and at a *good pace*.


## New Graphene-Django contributor: Jacob Foster

I'm pleased to welcome **Jacob Foster** into the Graphene-Django community as an **official contributor**.

He will start making sure that every issue and PR gets reviewed on time and future work is organized with Github Projects.

You can find him on [Github as @spockNinja](https://github.com/spockNinja).

## Want to contribute?

In projects like *Graphene-SQLAlchemy* we don't have any official contributors (*...yet!*).
**Would you like to be one?** [Contact me](mailto:me@syrusakbary.com)!

*PS: Also more people to help on Graphene, Graphene-Django and Graphene-SQLAlchemy will be always welcome*
