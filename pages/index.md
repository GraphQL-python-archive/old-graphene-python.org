  ## Easy and quick
  Getting started with Graphene is incredible easy. You will enjoy creating new APIs.

  ## Declarative
  Query responses are decided by the client rather than the server. A GraphQL query returns exactly what a client asks for and no more.
* ![plug](./plug.png)
  ## Pluggable
  Graphene will work out of box with your current stack. We have integrations with Django, SQLAlchemy, Flask, and Google App Engine.

# Explore a better way of creating APIs

Graphene is a Python library for building APIs with GraphQL easily.â€¨But, what is GraphQL? GraphQL is a data query language developed internally by Facebook in 2012 before being publicly released in 2015. It provides an alternate to REST and ad-hoc webservice architectures.

We believe that GraphQL is the next big thing after peanut butter and REST.

#### What is GraphQL?
*GraphQL* is a data query language and runtime designed to request and deliver data in a performant way.

Advantages of using *GraphQL*:

* No data overfetching or underfetching.
* Autogenerated Graphical UI and docs based in your schema.
